Many miniBB plugins will use this directory, so if you already have one, it is better to keep one directory for all shared files. No slash at the end!

$maxAvatarWidth=500; //maximum picture width in pixels. Set amount of maximum width and height ONLY if you have GD library installed, ELSE set them to 0 (any pic width and height will be allowed, just because it is impossible to determine w/h then).
$maxAvatarHeight=500; //maximum picture height in pixels. 

$staticAvatarSize=FALSE;// set to TRUE if you would like to allow to upload static size avatars ONLY (the size defined under $maxAvatarWidth and $maxAvatarHeight). This is the most suitable way if you're using threads layout model where username row is placed on top of a message text. Setting this to FALSE allows to upload various size avatars which fits under dimensions specified in $maxAvatarWidth and $maxAvatarHeight.
